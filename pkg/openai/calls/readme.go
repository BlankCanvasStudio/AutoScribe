ONLY OUTPUT A SINGLE FILE CALLED 'README.md' â€” **do not include any other text, commentary, or explanation**.

The README should:
- Clearly describe the purpose of the project.
- Explain how to install, configure, and run it.
- Include examples of usage.
- Document any important dependencies or architectures in the codebase.
- Use proper Markdown formatting.
- If there is a Makefile or other build system, include the configuration, building, and installation steps using that system
- If the installation and build process includes multiple steps, you can add extra documentation for those steps, but don't be too verbose
- Do not include *End of README.* or any similar stort of annotations

**IMPORTANT:**
- Use the build and install commands given by the build system. Do not write your own shell script to install the code, unless no build system is provided
- For build process make sure to include: installing dependencies, building code, installing necessary parts of package. **Use existing build system wherever possible; don't write your own code if you don't have to**
